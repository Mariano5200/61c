4.6.8 (08/21/2009):

1. Various bug fixes.

2. Adjust bug-submit to use registered emails as return addresses, and to 
   skip .svn directories.

4.6.0 (08/17/2009):

1. Add -w option to report-lateness to allow for deadline waivers.

4.5.1 (07/06/2009):

1. Try new method of cleaning up temp files to avoid leaving them around
   in the event of too many processes.

4.5.0 (06/09/2009):

   reports on the sum of scores for the listed assignments.

8. Added deadline-exceptions file to grading directory: allows instructors 
   to specify modified deadlines for specific students and assignments.

1. New naming convention for log files:  .../ASSGN/{ok,failed,mailed} rather
   than  .../{ok,failed,mailed}/ASSGN.

   line as the score.

5. Use registered email addresses for sending test results.

6. Change treatment of partnerships.  Enter-grades now adds partnerships
   automatically.  Removed the add-partners command.  Renamed get-partners
   to list-partners; it is now simply informational.

3.19.2 (11/08/2007):

1. Correct problem with "~" in mail messages.


3.19.1 (10/23/2007):

1. run-as-class-master may now be configured with a list of directories
   from which to get SUID scripts.  By default, $(GRADINGDIR)/suid is first
   on this list.

3.18.1 (01/09/2006):

1. The submit command now allows a -u LOGIN parameter so that instructors
   (or web-submission scripts) can submit on behalf of a student.  Submit also
   allows -b (batch mode) to allow non-interactive submission, and -f (force)
   to allow ignoring sanity checks.

3.17.0 (12/22/2005):

1. get-partners can now work without get-submissions, and can fetch 
   partnership information about an individual.

3.16.0 (11/7/2005):

1. Glookup now allows you to specify a name -- LAST or LAST,FIRST -- rather
   than a login.

2. Glookup -s for an individual student now includes student's score.

3.15.1 (10/14/2005):

1. Bug fixes in handling of -d in glookup.

3.15.0 (5/24/2005):

1. New -f option for glookup for producing -a output in comma-separated values
   (CSV) format.

3.14.0 (3/14/2005):

1. glookup now has options -s and -b for producing histograms and statistics.

2. The -req option now allows patterns.

3. Various documentation updates.

4. report-lateness distinguishes successful, unsuccessful, untested versions.

3/23/2004:

1. enter-grades, submit, glookup, check-missing all use setuid.  No
   special compilation of glookup is needed.

2. file-submissions is gone.

3. sweep-grades is replaced by check-reader-grades, which checks for
   missing grades and sends notices.

4. As part of the installation, you must compile and install setuid programs
   by the name of 'run-as-<class master login>' (e.g., run-as-cs61a)
   for each class and architecture.  These should be in the standard
   path that students see.  See the run-as-class-master source
   directory for installation instructions.

5. All documentation is updated (I think).

6. The directory structure is mostly backwards compatible, but I have
   tightened some permissions, now that that is possible.
