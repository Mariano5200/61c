Lab 2 Checkoff
==============

Part 1:
1.  How do you pass command line arguments to a program when using gdb?
        A.
2.  How do you set a breakpoint which only occurs when a set of conditions is true (e.g. when certain variables are a certain value)?
        A.
3.  How do you execute the next line of C code in the program after a break?
If the next line is a function call, you'll execute the call in one step. How do you execute the C code, line by line, inside the function call?
How do you continue running the program after breaking?
How can you see the value of a variable (or even an expression) in gdb?
How do you configure gdb so it prints the value of a variable after every step?
How do you print a list of all variables and their values in the current function?
How do you exit out of gdb?
