Prerequisites:

  You will need a perl interpreter, and the PRCS version-control system.
  See http://prcs.sourceforge.net.

Configuration:

  To configure, create a build directory, and in it, enter the command

	SDIR/configure OPTIONS

  where SDIR is where you have unpacked the distribution (it can be the same
  as the current directory, if needed).  

  Usually, it should suffice to specify one option: --prefix=DIR, where DIR
  is a directory that will contain the following upon installation:


     1.	DIR/share/bin:     Executable scripts
     2.	DIR/bin/arch/`uname -m`: 
			   Executable binaries for each architecture.
     3.	DIR/share/lib:	   Supporting Perl scripts and help text.
     4.	DIR/share/man:     Man pages (under man1).
     5. DIR/share/doc:     Some overview documentation.
     7. DIR/share/bin/suid:
			   Executable scripts that are run as class master.

  You can be more specific with these options, respectively:

     1. --sharebindir=...
     2. --bindir=...
     3. --libdir=...
     4. --mandir=...
     5. --docdir=...
     6. --suiddir=...

  In addition, the options

	--perl=PROG
	--prcs=PROG

  specify the command to use to invoke the perl interpreter and the PRCS
  version-control system.

Installation:

  To build and install, you need GNU make (which we just call 'make' below).
  Once configured, use

	make install-shared

  to install the share subdirectory, and

	make install-bin

  to install binaries.  The latter must be repeated on each platform you 
  intend to use; the first need only be done once.

  See run-as-class-master/README for details on installation of the 
  privileged wrapper programs.

Class Configuration and Use:

  See share/doc/OVERVIEW and share/doc/TESTING-OVERVIEW in the installation,
  and especially the init-grading command.
