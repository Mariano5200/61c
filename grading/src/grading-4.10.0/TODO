1. Grading aids.   

2. Correction utilities?

3. Define grouping so that it is convenient to assign readers to 
   sections (e.g.) and to print out grades of all students in a section.

4. Reject directories without proper names?

5. Documentation for testing.

6. Productize lateness computation?

7. GUI?

8. Redo in Python?

9. Make reader assignment easier somehow?

10. Flesh out the man pages.

12. Long option equivalents.

14. Allow graders easy access to partners' submissions (do the lookup 
    automatically).

16. Have just one command that dispatches to subcommands, as for svn,
    cvs, etc.

18. Debugging mode for run-tests, test-subm.

DONE:

*  Moreover, there ought to be an easy way to
   get a dump of all the scores on record for every student.  (I download
   all this stuff to Excel for easy statistics gathering, charting, etc.)

*  Somehow, a student registered without a SID. They then did not
   appear on our roster and when grades where entered the DB seemed
   to shift over a field so that the login of the grade assigner
   appeared where the grade should be, etc.
    
*  Several times this semester, I have forgotten to put an entry for
   the upcoming assignment into the params file, needlessly inconveniencing
   students who want to submit early.  It would be nice to be notified when
   a student tries to submit something that the system doesn't know about. 
   Probably this should be an option that could be turned off, since
   instructors more organized than I probably wouldn't want to deal with
   the junk mail.

*  Allow grade submission even when individual student turned nothing in
   for an assignment (change error to warning, perhaps?)

*  Codewords rather than SIDs for rosters.    

*  Better handling of bolixed/rejected submissions.

*  Big Glob: for LARGE sets of file names (some stupid limitation in
   regular glob), and not to give error message when directory does
   not exist.

*  14. torus% mail-results proj3 cs61b-em
	Ill-formed submission name to MailResult: .

*  The assign-letter-grades command needs better defaults.  I was
   disappointed to find after typing a (rather long) command that got me
   all the individual scores for students that it didn't give me their
   names, accounts, or sids.  

*  Modify assign-letter-grades for code words.

*  The grading program needs to be able to distinguish between a missing
   grade and a grade of 0.  Better yet would be a third category that
   distinguishes between "missing because you didn't submit it" and
   "missing because we haven't graded it yet".  Even better would be
   categories "missing because of an invalid submission" or "not graded
   because of late submission".

*  I hope for CS 170 this coming semester (and for future courses that
   involve paper submissions) to have someone collect the paper homework
   when it's due and then record "submissions" in the grading system prior
   to grading.

*  When submission does not exist, shouldn't get error messages from
   glob.

*  Better filtering of bogus characters in registration.

*  Sorting should not consider case (assign-letter-grades).

*  Don't allow duplicate SIDs [actually, we just warn.]

*  --no-display

*  Hidden comments.

*  Utility to spit out all current grade entries for a given assignment.

*  Include compilation of glookup in init-grades, or some such.

*  Allow separate, shared installation of shared software.

*  Allow parallel run-tests, without interference.

*  glookup -s should include actual score as well.  Also, combine first
   two lines, e.g.:  "Your score's rank:             19th out of 70"

*  glookup by student name, rather than just login

*  Easier partner lookups.

*  Allow abbreviation of logins in glookup.

*  Redo register so as not to rely on proper functioning of group setuid bit
   to compensate for incompetent file-system implementation by certain 
   manufacturers.

*  Add email entry to registration.

*  Modify interactive enter-grades to take comments on same line with score.

*  Use registered email address for mail.

*  Integrate svn submission.

*  GRADER variable is obsolete.

*  Version id.

* glookup -s ASSIGN1,ASSIGN2,...

* Have glookup -s compute mode.

* Add command to search for teams.

* Should be able to submit to partners using just team name for 
  assignments without submissions.

* Use 'submit' command with team name.

* Administrative routines to adjust individuals' deadlines.

* Run-tests is not counting "problems" as errors, and passing submissions
  that cause problems on all tests.

* Make svn refuse submissions that change existing subdirectories of 
  students' tags directories.

* Have bug-submit track the state of a submission (who is looking at it, 
  whether it is resolved, etc.).  [Separate utility: bug-track].

* report-lateness should have option for displaying all submissions 
  ONLY of students with late submissions.

* glookup -s gets 0-divide if max score is 0?

* check-reader-grades should use emails from registration.

* Prevent readers from overriding other readers' grades.

* Add extra ASSGN parameter to glookup -t.
